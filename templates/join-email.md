Therefore, don‚Äôt hesitate to show up in Slack and seek for teachers and TA‚Äôs whose names are listed in http://www.icub.org/school/**Year** üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç

Also, if you‚Äôre not a GitHubber yet, please [sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/join) (it‚Äôs free).
We're going to use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) extensively during the school for hosting code and material so as collaborating all together ‚ú®

Once you have a GitHub account, please do the following:
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository https://github.com/vvv-school/**Year** on your account.
2. In your newly created repository, [upload](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) one slide to support the self-introduction during the first school day. Put the file in the directory `students-introduction`.
3. [Create a Pull Request from your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) in order to submit the presentation upstream.
